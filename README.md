##Brace Yourself.

Empowers your brackets with colours.

apm install **swackets**

*Sourcecode must have recognised file extension and be focused to Swacketify.*

[Experimental: Toggle decoration style with **Cmd + Alt + S** if default mode does not work (Conflicting packages, unsupported file or Atom version <1.0.19)]

##TODO:

- Parenthesis support
- Multiple shades per colours (nesting level) to further aide usability
