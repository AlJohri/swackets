##Brace Yourself.

Empowers your brackets with colours.

apm install **swackets**

*Sourcecode must have recognised file extension and be focused to Swacketify.*

####Note: Atom tokenizer has (small) limit of 100 tokens parsed per line, so please install [Grammar-Token-Limit](https://atom.io/packages/grammar-token-limit) and increase to 200-400 for optimal Swackets experience on medium-long length lines

[Experimental: Supported on Atom 1.0.19+ with potential performance issues for very long files]

(Other packages may conflict with Swackets, if it is not working try disabling before raising issue)
