##Brace Yourself.

Empowers your brackets with colours.

apm install **swackets**

*Sourcecode must have recognised file extension and be focused to Swacketify.*

[Experimental: Supported on Atom 1.0.19+ with potential performance issues for very long files]

(Other packages may conflict with Swackets, if it is not working try disabling before raising issue)

##TODO:

- Parenthesis support
- Multiple shades per colour (nesting level) to further aide usability
